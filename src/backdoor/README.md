To incentivize the creation of more secure wallets in their team, someone has deployed a registry of Safe wallets. When someone in the team deploys and registers a wallet, they earn 10 DVT tokens.

The registry tightly integrates with the legitimate Safe Proxy Factory. It includes strict safety checks.

Currently there are four people registered as beneficiaries: Alice, Bob, Charlie and David. The registry has 40 DVT tokens in balance to be distributed among them.

Uncover the vulnerability in the registry, rescue all funds, and deposit them into the designated recovery account. In a single transaction.
