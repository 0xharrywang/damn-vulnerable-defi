# Unstoppable

There's a tokenized vault with a million DVT tokens deposited. It’s offering flash loans for free, until the grace period ends.

To catch any bugs before going 100% permissionless, the developers decided to run a live beta in testnet. There's a monitoring contract to check liveness of the flashloan feature.

Starting with 10 DVT tokens in balance, show that it's possible to halt the vault. It must stop offering flash loans.
